Concept of Operations

Start-up Sequence
1. Connect battery charger to batteries
2. Power-on battery charger (power button)
3. Enter automatic or manual mode of operation

Manual Mode
1. Select battery to be charged (1 or 2)
   (Menu selection using mode button)
2. Select charging mode for battery (fast, topping, trickle, storage)
   (Menu selection using mode button)
3. Start charging cycle(s) 
   (Menu selection using mode button??)
4. Stops after 24 hour trickle charge (return to main menu)

Automatic Mode
1. Selects battery #1 to start charging cycle
2. Selects charging mode based on battery voltage:
	a. Voltage >= minimum threshold --> Topping charge
	b. Voltage <  minimum threshold --> Fast charge
3. Switches to battery #2 after 24 hour trickle charge
4. Switches to storage mode after both battery #1 and #2 charged


State machine sequence for automatic mode:
1.  Startup initialization
2.  Battery #1 condition check
3.  Battery #1 fast charge (if voltage is low)
4.  Battery #1 topping charge
5.  Battery #1 trickle charge
6.  Battery #2 condition check 
7.  Battery #2 fast charge (if voltage is low)
8.  Battery #2 topping charge
9.  Battery #2 trickle charge
10. Storage (1 week)
11. Return to state #2


State machine sequence for manual mode:
1.  Startup initialization
2.  Select charge parameters
3.  Check condition of selected battery
3.  Run fast charge if selected
	* Run topping charge
	* Run trickle charge (24 hours)
4.  Run topping charge if selected
	* Run trickle charge (24 hours)
5.  Run load test if selected
6.  Return to state #2
